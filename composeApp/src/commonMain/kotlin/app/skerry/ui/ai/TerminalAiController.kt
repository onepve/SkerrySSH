/**
 * Terminal AI-bar controller: turns a natural-language request into ONE shell command under the
 * per-host [AiPolicy].
 *
 * Safety invariants:
 * - Confirmation before execution: [ask] only stores the proposed command in [pending]; it runs
 *   (is inserted into terminal input) only via explicit [confirm]. No auto-run under any policy;
 *   model output (including local) is untrusted.
 * - Policy + settings select the endpoint via [AiRouter]: [AiPolicy.Off] hides the bar;
 *   [AiPolicy.Strict] uses the local model only (absent it → [AiNotice.Blocked]); Balanced/Permissive use
 *   the configured provider, differing by prompt secret redaction ([SecretRedactor]).
 * - Model reply parsing/sanitization is in [AiReplyParser].
 *
 * Independent of Vault: settings supplied via [settings] lambda; [localInstalled] reports whether
 * the local model is downloaded on this device.
