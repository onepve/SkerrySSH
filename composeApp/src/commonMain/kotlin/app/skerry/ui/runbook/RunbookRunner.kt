/**
 * Drives one runbook through one terminal session: sends a step, waits for its exit code, pauses
 * where the runbook asks for a confirmation, and stops on a failure the policy doesn't tolerate.
 *
 * One session, deliberately. A procedure fanned out across a fleet has to guess what to do when one
 * host lags, one drops its connection and one stops to ask for a password — and every guess is
 * wrong somewhere. Rolling the same runbook onto the next host is a second run, started once the
 * operator has seen the first one land.
 *
 * Command steps go through the ordinary terminal input path rather than an exec channel, so `cd`,
 * exported variables and a cached `sudo` ticket carry from step to step, everything is visible in
 * the session the user is watching, and the production guard applies exactly as it does to typed
 * input. The exit code comes back through an escape sequence the step's probe emits and the terminal
 * never draws (see [RunbookMarker]), which the runner polls for — a PTY has no other way to report
 * status. Transfer steps have no
 * shell involved at all: they move a file over the session's SFTP channel and report what the
 * transfer threw, if anything.
 *
 * One run at a time, app-wide: a run outlives the screen showing it (switching tabs must not
 * abandon a half-finished procedure), so its lifecycle is owned here and ended explicitly by
 * [stop]/[close]. The vault gate calls [close] on lock — the resolved values of this run may include
 * secrets.
 *
 * The resolved command lines are never stored, only sent: they can carry a `${'$'}{{vault}}` secret, and
 * the terminal the user is already looking at is the honest record of what ran.
