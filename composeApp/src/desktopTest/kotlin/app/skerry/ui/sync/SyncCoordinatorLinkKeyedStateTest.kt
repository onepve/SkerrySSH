/**
 * Issues #242 and #243: what a piece of per-server state is filed under.
 *
 * One account id names two different accounts on a home and a work instance — that is why the reactivation
 * debt is keyed on the whole [ServerLink]. The delta cursor was not: it was keyed on the account id alone,
 * so two servers under one id shared one cursor and the second one's first pull started at the first one's
 * tip, silently skipping everything below it (#242). And the link itself was keyed on the URL exactly as
 * typed, so a variant spelling of the same server made a standing rebuild not owed (#243).
