/**
 * Authentication secret in the keychain — raw material (key/password/certificate) held by
 * [Credential]. Polymorphically serialized inside a vault record's encrypted payload; `@SerialName`
 * fixes a stable wire name in the discriminator so package renames or minification (R8) don't
 * make already-written blobs unreadable. The discriminator names ("password"/"private_key"/
 * "certificate") are inherited from the former `IdentityAuth`, so secrets written before the
 * keychain/host split read without a payload migration.
 *
 * `toString` is redacted — the secret must not leak into logs/crash reports. Secrets are held as
 * `String`: on the JVM they can't be zeroed (they live on the heap until GC); an accepted
 * limitation.
