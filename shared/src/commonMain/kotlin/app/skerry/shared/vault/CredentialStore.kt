/**
 * Store for [Credential] keychain secrets over a [Vault]: each secret is a [RecordType.CREDENTIAL]
 * record whose payload is a JSON serialization of [Credential] (label and secret inside the
 * encrypted blob). Pure common logic over the [Vault] contract — no platform part.
 *
 * Requires an unlocked vault for mutations: CRUD on a locked one throws from [Vault] itself.
 * Reading [all] on a locked vault safely returns an empty list (like [app.skerry.shared.host.VaultHostStore]):
 * sync-driven reloads may race a lock and must degrade, not crash. Records whose payload fails to
 * decrypt or parse (corruption/incompatible migration) are silently skipped — one broken record
 * must not break the whole list.
