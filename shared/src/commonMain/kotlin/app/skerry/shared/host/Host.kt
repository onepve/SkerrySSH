/**
 * Saved connection profile in the host manager. Identity is the stable [id] (assigned at creation,
 * unchanged by edits), so renaming [label] or changing the address doesn't lose history/references.
 * [label] is the display name, [address] is the host or IP to dial, [group] is an optional folder
 * for list grouping.
 *
 * The secret itself is not stored here: it lives in the encrypted vault as
 * [app.skerry.shared.vault.Credential] (keychain), and the profile references it by [credentialId]
 * (a reusable secret — one key/password for multiple hosts). `null` means no secret is attached and
 * the password is entered at connect time.
 *
 * [tags] are optional labels for filtering the host list (#prod/#docker chips). Stored in canonical
 * form (no `#`, lowercase, deduplicated, ≤ [app.skerry.shared.tag.MAX_TAG_LENGTH]) via
 * [app.skerry.shared.tag.normalizeTag]; [group] (folder) and
 * [tags] (labels) are independent.
 *
 * [aiPolicy] is the per-host AI policy ("AI under policy" principle). Default [AiPolicy.Strict] is
 * safe: for both existing hosts (field absent) and new ones, cloud is denied until the user
 * deliberately relaxes the policy. Serialized by name (backward compatible).
 *
 * [connectionType] is the profile's transport (see [ConnectionType]). Default [ConnectionType.SSH]
 * preserves backward compatibility: old files without the field read as SSH. For
 * [ConnectionType.MOSH] every SSH field applies unchanged (address/port/credential/jump name the
 * SSH hop that launches `mosh-server`); [keepAliveSeconds] is inert (Mosh heartbeats itself). For
 * [ConnectionType.TELNET] only [address]/[port] matter (no auth/secret). For [ConnectionType.SERIAL]
 * [address] holds the device name (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `COM3`) and [port] holds the baud rate;
 * [username]/[credentialId] are unused.
 *
 * [jumpHostId] is an optional ProxyJump reference to another saved SSH profile: the connection is
 * tunneled through that host (which may itself have a jump — a multi-hop chain). SSH-only; stored
 * by id (like [credentialId]) so renaming/re-addressing the jump host doesn't break the link. The
 * chain is resolved at connect time (`resolveJumpChain` in the UI layer): a dangling id, a non-SSH
 * jump, a secretless jump or a cycle fails the connect rather than silently going direct.
 *
 * [keepAliveSeconds] is the keep-alive cadence for this profile's sessions: every N seconds the
 * client sends `keepalive@openssh.com` so NAT/firewall tables don't expire an idle connection
 * (OpenSSH's `ServerAliveInterval`). 0 disables it. SSH-only (Telnet/Serial ignore it). Default 30
 * also covers old saved files (field absent).
 *
 * [vncResizeToWindow] remembers the VNC session's "Resize to window" toggle across restarts.
 * VNC-only; toggled from the live session's graphics menu, not the edit form (which preserves it).
