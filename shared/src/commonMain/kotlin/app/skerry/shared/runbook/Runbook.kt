/**
 * A saved runbook: an ordered checklist run against one or more hosts, one step at a time. Where a
 * snippet is a single line the user fires and forgets, a runbook is the procedure around it —
 * "drain the node, upload the release, restart the service, check it came back" — and the human
 * stays in the loop: a step marked [RunbookStep.confirm] waits for an explicit go-ahead, and a step
 * that fails stops the run instead of carrying on into the next command.
 *
 * Identity is the stable [id] (assigned at creation, unchanged by edits); [label] is the display
 * name, [description] an optional note shown while the run is in progress (what this procedure is
 * for, when to abort). [tags] group runbooks in the library exactly like snippet tags. [policy] is
 * how the run as a whole behaves — see [RunbookPolicy].
 *
 * Steps carry the same `${{…}}` variables as snippets ([app.skerry.shared.snippet.SnippetTemplate]);
 * they are resolved once for the whole run, so a placeholder used in two steps means the same value
 * in both (see [RunbookScript]).

 * run continue past failures; a single step can opt out either way with
 * [RunbookStep.continueOnError].
 *
 * [watchdogMinutes] is how long a step may print nothing before the run flags it as possibly stuck
 * (an unterminated here-doc, a command still waiting on stdin, a shell without `$?`). It never ends
 * a step — `sleep 3600` and a silent migration look identical from outside — it only says so.

 *
 * [title] names the step in the progress list ("Drain the node"); with none, the step's own command
 * or paths stand in for it.
 *
 * [confirm] pauses the run before this step and waits for the user — the default, because a runbook
 * that runs end to end unattended is just a shell script. Clearing it is for the harmless checks
 * (`uptime`, `systemctl status`) that would otherwise make the user click through noise.
 *
 * [continueOnError] keeps the run going when this particular step fails, whatever the runbook's
 * [RunbookPolicy.stopOnFirstFailure] says — for steps whose failure is expected and informational
 * (a `grep` that finds nothing, a cleanup of something that may not exist).
 *
 * Stored with a `kind` discriminator, added when transfer steps arrived; a step written before that
 * has none and reads as a [Command] (see [RunbookStepSerializer]).
