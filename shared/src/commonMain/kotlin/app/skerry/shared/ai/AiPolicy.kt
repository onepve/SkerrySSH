/**
 * Per-host AI policy ("AI under policy" principle). Model output is
 * an untrusted source; the policy decides whether context can go to the cloud and whether secrets
 * must be scrubbed. Confirmation before command execution is always required regardless of policy
 * (separate UI invariant).
 *
 * - [Strict] — local AI only. Sanitizes secrets. Default for new hosts.
 * - [Balanced] — cloud allowed, secrets scrubbed before sending.
 * - [Permissive] — cloud allowed without sanitization (non-sensitive systems only).
 * - [Off] — AI disabled entirely for this host.
 *
 * Value order matches the UI ordering; serialization is by name, so order doesn't affect backward
 * compatibility of saved hosts.
