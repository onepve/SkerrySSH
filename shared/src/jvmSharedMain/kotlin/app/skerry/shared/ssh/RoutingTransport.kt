/**
 * Transport router: delegates connection setup to the right implementation — SSH (sshj), Mosh,
 * Telnet or Serial — based on [SshTarget.connectionType]. Keeps the session/terminal/reconnect
 * stack (`ConnectionController` in the UI layer) working over any of them through a single call
 * site.
 *
 * [ssh] is injected from outside (carries its own [HostKeyVerifier]/known-hosts); Mosh bootstraps
 * over that same SSH transport, so host-key trust and ProxyJump behave identically. Telnet/Serial
 * are stateless and default-constructed, but can be swapped in tests too.
